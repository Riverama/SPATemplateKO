###Project Description
Simple ASP.NET MVC & KockoutJS based SPA template 
<p>
This is a custom version of the ASP.NET MVC template modified to turn it into a Single Page Application type project. 
It is similar to Angular based structures, but utilizing Knckout.js instead to handle model-views in the client side.
</p>

The core of this structure is based on [Knockout 3.2 Components](http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/component-overview.html) and it's inspired by work from 
 [Steve Sanderson's talk on SPA architecture](http://vimeo.com/97519516) 

<p>
 The project allows traditional ASP.NET MVC Server Side actions/views to be called and injected along with client side models as pages in the application; this provides the added benefit of being able to do standard server side processing in Controllers prior to presentation.
